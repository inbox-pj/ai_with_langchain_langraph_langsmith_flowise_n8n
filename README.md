# Prompt Engineering
## Best practices for prompt engineering:
	• Be clear and specific: Clearly state the task, context, and desired output.
	• Use examples: Provide input-output pairs to guide the model.
	• Set constraints: Specify format, length, or style requirements.
	• Break down complex tasks: Use step-by-step instructions or chain-of-thought prompts.
	• Iterate and refine: Test, analyze outputs, and adjust prompts for better results.
	• Avoid ambiguity: Use precise language and avoid vague terms.
	• Use system messages: Set behavior or tone if supported (e.g., “You are a helpful assistant.”).
	• Leverage role prompting: Assign roles to guide responses (e.g., “Act as a senior Java developer.”).
	• Test edge cases: Ensure prompts handle unusual or unexpected inputs.
	• Document prompts: Keep track of prompt versions and their effectiveness.


## Prompt engineering format
	• Role: Specify which role or capabilities the AI should assume.
	• Tasks/Instruction: Clearly state what you want the model to do.
	• Context: Provide background information or relevant details.
	• Input Data: Supply any data or examples needed for the task.
	• Goal: Define what is the outcome of the task should achieve.
	• Constraints: Specify requirements (e.g., output format, length, style).
	• Output Format: Determine how the result should be presented.


## Core prompting techniques for LLMs
	• Zero-shot prompting: Ask the model to perform a task without providing any examples.
	• Few-shot prompting: Provide a few input-output examples to guide the model’s behavio
	• Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting: Encourage the model to reason step-by-step by explicitly asking for intermediate steps.
